# Dahua_ASI1201E_SDK

C# (c-sharp)

A custom software development kit for Dahua ASI1201E/ASI1201E-D devices, which are developed by using the original SDK examples from the official web-site: https://www.dahuasecurity.com/products/All-Products/Access-Control--Time-Attendance/Access-Control/Standalone/ASI1201E/ASI1201E-D

-You can turn this class into a class library. I did not need that.

-For being able to use this class in your project, you first need to download the original SDK from its web site which is given above. Then you need to import some dll files from the debug folder into your project. As I can remember there were 3-5 dll files. Most important one is NetSDKCS.

-Some of the method and attribute names are written in Turkish, if you need you can simply translate them.

-You can also ask questions...
